# Channel Types

## Public channel

Public channels can be subscribed to by anyone who knows their name.

## Private channel

Private channels should have a `private-` prefix. They introduce a mechanism which lets your server control access to the data you are broadcasting.

## Presence channel

Presence channels should have a `presence-` prefix and are an extension of private channels. They let you ‘register’ user information on subscription, and let other members of the channel know who’s online.
